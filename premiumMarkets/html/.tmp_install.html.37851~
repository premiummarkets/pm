you need to have <A HREF="http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp" TARGET="_blank">java</A>
installed to run this program : <A HREF="http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp" TARGET="_blank">you
can start here</A>.<BR><BR>What is good here is that you don't have
to unjar, unzip, untar or what ever. (If you understood that, you are
nearly done!)<BR>Just click on the following : 
<SPAN><A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pmsqueak/">Sourceforge</A><BR>.<BR><BR>Alternatively
you can download the big jar file in a folder, go in the latest and
run : </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><B>java -jar pms-0.x.x.jar</B></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
or java -jar &lt;what ever you renamed it&gt; </SPAN>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Yes,
a successful software installation is sometimes the tricky bit as
there can be OS specificities on the way. <BR>So if you have a
problem installing, and you are one of these who don't give up
easily, please follow the instructions below. <BR><BR>Have you tried
this link : <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pmsqueak/">Sourceforge</A>
? <BR><BR>If this still doesn't work you can download the jar from
here (click on the latest release and then the jar file) :
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=214811">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=214811</A>
<BR></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Don't unpack it. </SPAN></STRONG><SPAN LANG="en-GB">But
save it somewhere on your file system. When it's all here, just go in
the folder and run </SPAN><STRONG><SPAN LANG="en-GB">java -jar
pms-0.x.x.jar</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> on the command
line.<BR>On MS Windows you should actually be able to run it just by
double clicking on the jar.<BR><BR>You should then just have to
follow the instructions step by step.<BR><BR>Good luck.</SPAN></P>
