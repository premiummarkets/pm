1 - Specialize TalibIndicators 
	=> Write (Override ?!)  calculate<Indicator> method + specific attributes -> that's a kind of mandatory so ...
	=> Over write calculateEvent method. 
		-> kind of mandatory as well!! 
		-> Or use a scripting language like ruby to define calculation rules??
2 - Add an event in the Enum EventDefinition
3 - Instantiate new indicator in the TalibIndicatorCalculationService.calculateAllMACD 
		-> will go in DB or Spring.xml with algebra and formulas
