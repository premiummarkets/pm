1 - Specialize HttpSource 
	=> Specialize HttpSourceMarket
		/* 
		=> the only difference is in the url returned by getMarketStockListURL(String, String, String, StockCategories)

				and create a market list resource apart from quotation source + add url in prop file. 
		*/
2 - Specialize Providers
	=> Specialize ProvidersMarket
	/*
	=> the only differences are :
		- currency
		- getStockRefName is specialized : either isin or symbol
		- public StockList retreiveStockListFromWeb(MarketQuotationProviders marketQuotationsProviders, StockList stockList) : 
			change httpSource and formatter refs
	=> currency has to go in a props file + object refs should be the same now as thing are done in configs ...
	=> PB : isin vs symbol ...
	=> Todo : same as above, market list and quotation should be two distinct services.
	*/
